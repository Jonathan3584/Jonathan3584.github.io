            <h3>Lauren Trustman Noyes</h3>
            <div id="content-body">
                <p class="attorney-body-text">
                    Lauren, a native of Raleigh, North Carolina, is enthusiastic about melding her experience in campaigns with her legal training.  In 2016-17, she worked as a field manager for three different candidates: a local municipal race, a legislative campaign, and a Court of Appeals re-election campaign.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lauren graduated from Brown University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Religious Studies.  Her love of cooking led her to complete an Associate of Science degree in Culinary Science from Johnson & Wales University in Miami, Florida.  Lauren then went on to earn her Juris Doctor degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  While in law school, Lauren was a member of the North Carolina Law Review. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After law school, Lauren clerked for the Honorable Robin Hudson at the North Carolina Court of Appeals.  She then practiced law with The Jernigan Law Firm representing individuals injured on the job or in accidents.  She developed strong relationships with clients during challenging times in their lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lauren felt fortunate to have the opportunity to be home with her 3 children while her family moved up and down the East Coast for her husband’s job.  She was thrilled to return to her hometown, spend more time with her family, and get re-involved in the Wake County legal community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lauren is actively engaged with her community in many capacities.  She serves as the Vice-President and Advocacy Chair of her children’s school PTA, volunteers in numerous classrooms, and helps support the most food-insecure students at her children’s public schools.  In addition, she works as a Sunday school teacher in her congregation and serves on the Congregation Board, Religious School committee, and Finance committee.  She loves to cook, exercise, read, and spend time with her family and friends.
